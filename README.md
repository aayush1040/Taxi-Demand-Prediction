# Taxi-Demand-Prediction

Predict the pick up density of yellow cabs at a given particular time and a location in new york city.
Yellow Taxi: Yellow Medallion Taxicabs
These are the famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged. In this project we are considering only the yellow taxis for the year of 2015 The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)
